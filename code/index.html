          <div class="answer">
            <p>There are almost 200 known species of jellyfish drifting through our planetâ€™s seas. Many of them are harmless, some can cause pain, and in rare cases some can be deadly.</p>

          <div class="answer">
            <p>Jellyfish range from about one millimeter in bell height and diameter to nearly 2 metres in bell height
            and diameter; the tentacles and mouth parts usually extend beyond this bell dimension.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question" id="section3">Where do Jellyfish live?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>Jellyfish are found all over the world, from surface waters to the deep sea. Most are exclusively marine, but some live in freshwater.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question" id="section4">When did they first appear?</div>
          <div class="answer">
